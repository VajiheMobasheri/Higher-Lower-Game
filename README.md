# Higher-Lower-Game
The Higher Lower game project provides the user with information about two famous individuals and asks the user to guess which celebrity has more followers. Each correct guess adds a point to the user's score. The game ends as soon as the user makes an incorrect guess.
The list of celebrities is placed in `famouspeople.py`. Naturally, this list can be expanded.
